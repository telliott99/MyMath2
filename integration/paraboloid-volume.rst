Paraboloid volume
#################

A paraboloid is a solid whose vertical cross-section is a parabola (often, it is oriented along the :math:`z`-axis).  It may open up, or down.  The cross-sections parallel to the :math:`xy`-plane are typically circles, though the shape factors for the parabolas in the :math:`xz`- and :math:`yz`-planes could be different, leading to an ellipse for the cross-sections.

Consider

.. math::

    z = 2 - x^2 - y^2 

This is a paraboloid that opens down (:math:`z` gets large and negative when either :math:`x` or :math:`y` get large).  The vertex is at :math:`z=2`.  When :math:`z=0`, the cross-section is a circle

.. math::

    x^2 + y^2 = 2 

of radius :math:`r=\sqrt{2}`.

Usually, cylindrical coordinates are good for dealing with this solid.  For example, in those coordinates, the surface area element is :math:`dS = r \ dz \ d \theta`.

But let's start with a method from 1-D calculus.  Suppose we turn the paraboloid so that its symmetry axis is the :math:`x`-axis, and its vertex is at the origin.  We can model this as being generated by revolution of the graph of :math:`f(x) = \sqrt{x}` around the :math:`x`-axis.

The general formulation is that at each point :math:`x`, we have a circle of radius :math:`f(x)` and area :math:`\pi f(x)^2`.

Here, :math:`f(x)=\sqrt{x}`, and area :math:`A = \pi r^2 = \pi x`.  If we consider the width of each slice to be :math:`dx`, then for the volume just add all these up

.. math::

    V(x) = \int A(x) \ dx = \int \pi x \ dx 

    = \frac{\pi}{2} \ x^2 \ \bigg |_a^b 

For the unit paraboloid at :math:`b=1`, we get :math:`\pi/2`.  And our first paraboloid (:math:`b=2`) has a volume of

.. math::

    V = 2 \pi 

Now, consider the shape factor for the parabola, :math:`a`.  In the standard equation :math:`y=ax^2`, and the larger :math:`a` is, the faster the parabola grows in the :math:`y`-direction.  But here, we have the parabola "opening" in the :math:`+x`-direction.  That is, we have :math:`x = a y^2` and so :math:`y= \sqrt{x/a}`.  Thus

.. math::

    V(x) = \int A(x) \ dx = \pi \int \frac{x}{a} \ dx =  \frac{\pi}{a} \int x \ dx 

and we have a factor of :math:`1/a` for the final volume.

We can ask in another way if these formulas make sense.  Consider the parabola :math:`y=x^2` in the unit square.  The area "under" the curve is :math:`1/3`, which is another way of saying that the area "over" the curve and inside the parabola is :math:`2/3`.  Compare with the circle, whose area over the unit square is :math:`\pi/4 \approx 3/4`.  The circle is a bit "fatter" than the parabola and we expect its volume, when we do the rotation, to be larger in proportion.  So this looks reasonable.

Another method

I want to find the volume using cylindrical coordinates.  I'd also like to generalize the problem.  In 1D we orient the vertex at the origin and integrate (usually) from :math:`0 \rightarrow b`.  When we turn the volume so that it aligns with the :math:`z`-axis, we usually place it with the bottom of the desired region in the :math:`xy`-plane.  So I'm going to re-write the equation as

.. math::

    z = f(x,y) = c - x^2 - y^2 

where c is the height of the parabola we are measuring.

We are going to use :math:`r, \theta, z`.  So we need to find the limits on :math:`r`.  The "shadow" of the paraboloid is a circle in the :math:`x,y`-plane

.. math::

    z = 0 = c - x^2 - y^2 

    x^2 + y^2 = r^2 = c 

    r = \sqrt{c} 

The volume in cylindrical coordinates is

.. math::

    V = \iiint dV = \iiint r \ dz \ dr \ d \theta 

What are the bounds on :math:`z`?  Remember, if we integrate first with respect to :math:`z` then :math:`r` is \emph{fixed}.  For a given :math:`r`

.. math::

    z =  c - r^2  

So, the bounds on :math:`z` are :math:`z=0 \rightarrow c - r^2`, and the inner integral is just

.. math::

    \int_0^{c-r^2} r \ dz = r( c-r^2) 

This gives us what we would have if we just started by thinking about the double integral of :math:`f(x,y)` or :math:`f(r,\theta)` over the region :math:`R` in the plane.

.. math::

    V = \iint f(x,y) \ dx \ dy = \iint f(r,\theta) \ r \ dr \ d \theta 

The middle integral is

.. math::

    \int_0^{\sqrt{c}} cr - r^3 \ dr 

    = \frac{1}{2}cr^2 - \frac{1}{4}r^4 \ \bigg |_0^{\sqrt{c}} 

    = \frac{1}{2}c^2 - \frac{1}{4}c^2 =  \frac{1}{4}c^2 

times :math:`2 \pi` from the outer integral.  Hence :math:`V= \pi/2 \cdot c^2`.

The way we've set up this problem, the region that we want starts at the :math:`xy`-plane.  So there's not much point in preserving the option of starting evaluation of the middle integral at :math:`a \ne 0`.  But if you did decide to do this you could.  Just remember to go back and fix the lower bound on :math:`z` in the inner integral.  That would also have to change.

Double paraboloid

Just for fun, let's try to do a double paraboloid.  In the figure, the paraboloid that opens up is :math:`z= x^2 + y^2` while the one that opens down is :math:`z = 1-x^2 - y^2`.  To match what we had in the earlier section, I'm going to change the upper one to be :math:`z = 2-x^2 - y^2`.

We will use cylindrical coordinates to integrate.  The key to the problem, as usual, is to find the limits for :math:`r` and :math:`z`.  First, solve for the intersection of the two surfaces:

.. math::

    z = 2-x^2 - y^2 = x^2 + y^2 

    x^2 + y^2 = 1 = r^2 

So :math:`r = 0 \rightarrow 1`.  Easy enough.  And :math:`z` ranges from the lower surface to the upper one.  Our integral is

.. math::

    V = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 \int_{r^2}^{2-r^2} \ dz \ r \ dr \ d \theta 

The middle integral is

.. math::

    \int_0^1 2 - 2r^2 \ r \ dr \ d \theta 

    = 2\ (\frac{r^2}{2} - \frac{r^4}{4}) \ \bigg |_0^1 

    = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} 

Multiply by :math:`2\pi` from the outer integral and that gives simply, :math:`\pi`.  Notice that we have a duplicated version of the first volume, for which we found the answer :math:`\pi/2`.  It checks.
